### Che system

# System Super Privileged Mode.
# Grants users with the manageSystem permission additional permissions for
# getByKey, getByNameSpace, stopWorkspaces, and getResourcesInformation.
# These are not given to admins by default and these permissions allow
# admins gain visibility to any workspace along with naming themselves
# with admin privileges to those workspaces.
che.system.super_privileged_mode=false

# Grant system permission for 'che.admin.name' user. If the user already exists it'll happen on
# component startup, if not - during the first login when user is persisted in the database.
che.system.admin_name=admin

### Workspace limits

# Workspaces are the fundamental runtime for users when doing development. You can set
# parameters that limit how workspaces are created and the resources that are consumed.
# The maximum amount of RAM that a user can allocate to a workspace when they
# create a new workspace. The RAM slider is adjusted to this maximum value.
che.limits.workspace.env.ram=16gb

# The length of time that a user is idle with their workspace when the system will
# suspend the workspace and then stopping it. Idleness is the
# length of time that the user has not interacted with the workspace, meaning that
# one of our agents has not received interaction. Leaving a browser window open
# counts toward idleness.
che.limits.workspace.idle.timeout=1800000

### Users workspace limits

# The total amount of RAM that a single user is allowed to allocate to running
# workspaces. A user can allocate this RAM to a single workspace or spread it
# across multiple workspaces.
che.limits.user.workspaces.ram=-1

# The maximum number of workspaces that a user is allowed to create. The user will
# be presented with an error message if they try to create additional workspaces.
# This applies to the total number of both running and stopped workspaces.
che.limits.user.workspaces.count=-1

# The maximum number of running workspaces that a single user is allowed to have.
# If the user has reached this threshold and they try to start an additional
# workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The user will need to
# stop a running workspace to activate another.
che.limits.user.workspaces.run.count=1

### Organizations workspace limits

# The total amount of RAM that a single organization (team) is allowed to allocate
# to running workspaces. An organization owner can allocate this RAM however they
# see fit across the team's workspaces.
che.limits.organization.workspaces.ram=-1

# The maximum number of workspaces that a organization is allowed to own. The
# organization will be presented an error message if they try to create
# additional workspaces. This applies to the total number of both running
# and stopped workspaces.
che.limits.organization.workspaces.count=-1

# The maximum number of running workspaces that a single organization is allowed.
# If the organization has reached this threshold and they try to start an
# additional workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The
# organization will need to stop a running workspace to activate another.
che.limits.organization.workspaces.run.count=-1

# Address that will be used as from email for email notifications

### Multi-user-specific OpenShift infrastructure configuration

# Alias of the Openshift identity provider registered in Keycloak,
# that should be used to create workspace OpenShift resources in
# Openshift namespaces owned by the current Che user.
# Should be set to NULL if `che.infra.openshift.project`
# is set to a non-empty value.
# For more information see the following documentation:
# https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/identity-broker/social/openshift.html
che.infra.openshift.oauth_identity_provider=NULL

### Keycloak configuration

# Url to keycloak identity provider server
# Can be set to NULL only if `che.keycloak.oidcProvider`
# is used
che.keycloak.auth_server_url=http://${CHE_HOST}:5050/auth

# Keycloak realm is used to authenticate users
# Can be set to NULL only if `che.keycloak.oidcProvider`
# is used
che.keycloak.realm=che

# Keycloak client id in che.keycloak.realm that is used by dashboard, ide and cli to authenticate users
che.keycloak.client_id=che-public

### RedHat Che specific configuration

# URL to access OSO oauth tokens
che.keycloak.oso.endpoint=NULL

# URL to access Github oauth tokens
che.keycloak.github.endpoint=NULL

# The number of seconds to tolerate for clock skew when verifying exp or nbf claims.
che.keycloak.allowed_clock_skew_sec=3

# Use the OIDC optional `nonce` feature to increase security.
che.keycloak.use_nonce=true

# URL to the Keycloak Javascript adapter we want to use.
# if set to NULL, then the default used value is
# `${che.keycloak.auth_server_url}/js/keycloak.js`,
# or `<che-server>/api/keycloak/OIDCKeycloak.js`
# if an alternate `oidc_provider` is used
che.keycloak.js_adapter_url=NULL

# Base URL of an alternate OIDC provider that provides
# a discovery endpoint as detailed in the following specification
# https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig

# Set to true when using an alternate OIDC provider that
# only supports fixed redirect Urls
# This property is ignored when `che.keycloak.oidc_provider` is NULL
che.keycloak.use_fixed_redirect_urls=false

# Username claim to be used as user display name
# when parsing JWT token
# if not defined the fallback value is 'preferred_username'
che.keycloak.username_claim=NULL

# Configuration of OAuth Authentication Service that can be used in "embedded" or "delegated" mode.
# If set to "embedded", then the service work as a wrapper to Che's OAuthAuthenticator ( as in Single User mode).
# If set to "delegated", then the service will use Keycloak IdentityProvider mechanism.
# Runtime Exception wii be thrown, in case if this property is not set properly.
che.oauth.service_mode=embedded
